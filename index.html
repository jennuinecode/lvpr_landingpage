                <a>Once again, we are beyond grateful at the gift you gave us in allowing to document your love story.<br>
                We hope that the wait was worth it and that you enjoy not only the extra images we were able to provide,
                but our little gift box as well.

                Below, you will see the direct link to your online gallery for easy sharing/viewing with those you love.<br>
                However, as you have already seen, you will also have something physical to hold your images...<br>
                for you to carry
                with you, to pass down, or simply as a keepsake with the best date of your lives.</a>
